# Welcome to IntuneMaps

This is a small passion project of mine. Microsoft Intune has evolved like never before and continuing to add more features as we speak I always wanted to create a one-stop location for all things Intune Windows Platform that can be helpful to anyone who is starting out with the product, looking for the right Learn article to get things done or simply shopping around.

This is Version 1.0 and I would like to make this a continuous working infographic document. A PDF of the same infograph can be found in the GitHub repo and please feel free to comment and suggest or raise issues if needed.

You will see the versions of the IntuneMaps.Tech. Please download the PDF file if you need to see the functionality.

Current Version Can be found here - https://intunemaps.com/
